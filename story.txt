Once upon a time, there was a yellow duck named Fred who lived on a farm in south-central Chicago.

Fred would spend his days idly waddling back and forth, thinking about how expensive it was to own a farm in south central Chicago. One day Fred was visited 
by a travelling squirrel from Indianapolis.
