Once upon a time, there was a yellow duck named Fred who lived on a farm in south-central Chicago.

Fred would spend his days idly waddling back and forth, thinking about how expensive it was to own a farm in south central Chicago. One day Fred was visited 
by a travelling squirrel from Indianapolis. 

The squirrel took a liking to Fred, and ended up spending all day with Fred waxing poetically about the virtues of Indianapolis. The squirrel was so convincing that Fred decided to move his farm there.

Fred packed up his seeds and his animals and rented a Uhaul. He would buy a new farm when he got there - he wanted to see the city first. And try a fast food place that Fred had reccommended with unlimited breadsticks called Fazoli's.
